# sargo-extract-vendor-files
These are scripts to extract missing vendor files from a factory image for AOSP

In making default AOSP, not all of the needed proprietary files are included. These are helper scripts to include the necessary changes, and were adapted from lineageOS.

Note that I made this specific to the Google Pixel 3a (Sargo), but it can be adapted for other devices.

For Usage on Android Pie, look in UsagePie.md

For Usage on Android 10, look in Usage10.md

NOTE: Android 10 is still in Beta, I currently have an unbootable system with it.
